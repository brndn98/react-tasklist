## Simple Task List App

This is a simple React task list app with **Hooks** and **Context**.

### React Context

React Context was used to manage the app state throughout all the components.<br />

### React Hooks

React Hooks was used to develop the app based on function components.<br />
This app uses the hooks:<br />
`useContext` to access the app state context providers.<br />
`useState` for the state of the components.<br />
`useEffect` to manage the app state on updates.<br />
`useRef` to manipulate a scrolling effect on the DOM.
